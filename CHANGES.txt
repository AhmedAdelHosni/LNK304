Created new devices in the library

Schematic:
- Created new library for AC plug
- Added hot and neutral pins for AC plug concept

PCB Layout:
- Revised Terminal Block size and overlapping with D2
- Probably won't need to decrease the board height by 2mm
- Neglect creepage between C1 and C2 pads at the moment
- Increased L2 pad distance a bit by creating a new library ELL-6UH681M

** 27.Mar.2016 **
Schematic:
- Added passive componets' values which were removed by mistake 

PCB Layout:
- Smash passive components and remove passive components' values

-- Missing --
- Need to add hot and neutral pins for AC plug concept
- Need to revise Terminal Block size and overlapping with D2
- May need to increase L2 pad distance a bit
- May need to decrease the board height by 2mm
- Add Creepage between C1 and C2 pads
- Revise the two holes diameter and availability of screws

** 26.Mar.2016 **
Schematic:
- Added a 1M 1/2Watt beelding resistor between hot and neutral
- Added Varistor VR1

PCB Layout:
- Change board height to 49.5mm 
- Change trace width to 40mil
- Added a 1M 1/4Watt beelding resistor between hot and neutral
- Change layout of D2 to be shorter so that AC Terminal Block can fit
- Added Varistor VR1

-- Missing --
- Need to add hot and neutral pins for AC plug concept
- Need to revise Terminal Block size and overlapping with D2
- May need to increase L2 pad distance a bit
- May need to decrease the board height by 2mm
- Add Creepage between C1 and C2 pads
- Revise the two holes diameter and availability of screws

-- What can be changed --
- Hot and Neutral pins can be in one signale TBlock02 not 03

** 26.Mar.2016 **
- Checked in new file userdefined.lbr
- Created new device LNK30X
- The device has Symbol name LNK30X
- The device has Package name SO08C

Schematic:
- Added the new package LNK30X and rename component to LNK304

PCB Layout:
- Route the new package LNK30X
- Smash right side components and re organise the components names on the silk screen
- Added two holes

-- Missing --
- Need to add hot and neutral pins for AC plug concept
- Need to revise Terminal Block size and overlapping with D2
- May need to increase L2 pad distance a bit
- May need to decrease the board height by 2mm
- Add Creepage between C1 and C2 pads
- Revise the two holes diameter and availability of screws

** 21.Mar.2016 **
Schematic:
- Added pin headers for 9v output which will be used by the relays
- Added extra ground pin to CONTR component

PCB Layout:
- Added pin headers for 9v output which will be used by the relays
- Added extra ground pin to CONTR component
- Added two 1mm holes
- Added Ground plane

Missing:
- Same issues 
- Add Creepage between C1 and C2 pads
- Smash right side components and re organise the components names on the silk screen

** 19.Mar.2016 **
Schematic:
- Change RF1 to fuse component
- Added Controller pin headers

PCB Layout:
- Increase board length from 46mm to 49.5mm
- Re orientation of components
RF1, D1, C1, C2, L2 R3 are the main components which were moved for long distance
- Added Common Plane for Source pin of LNK

-- Missing --
- Need to revise Terminal Block size and overlapping with D2
- The LNK layout used till now is not the correct one.
- May need to increase L2 pad distance a bit
- May need to decrease the board height by 2mm

NOTE: Till now the design is just a fast draft. You can see that some traces are not drawn in a clean way.
