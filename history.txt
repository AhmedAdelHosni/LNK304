Schematic:
- Change RF1 to fuse component
- Added Controller pin headers

PCB Layout:
- Increase board length from 46mm to 49.5mm
- Re orientation of components
RF1, D1, C1, C2, L2 R3 are the main components which were moved for long distance
- Added Common Plane for Source pin of LNK

-- Missing --
- Need to revise Terminal Block size and overlapping with D2
- The LNK layout used till now is not the correct one.
- May need to increase L2 pad distance a bit
- May need to decrease the board height by 2mm

NOTE: Till now the design is just a fast draft. You can see that some traces are not drawn in a clean way.
